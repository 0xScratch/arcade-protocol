# Overview of Contracts

### **_See natspec for technical detail._**

The Arcade Lending protocol's smart contracts can be grouped into three main categories:

- **Core Lending**: These smart contracts define the core lending protocol mechanics. The main features implemented include collateral escrow, the loan lifecycle state machine, on-chain storage of loan information, and protocol invariants.
- **Vaults**: The Asset Vault is a smart contract, whose ownership is tracked by an NFT, that can be used to bundle multiple items of collateral for a single loan. Vaults also provide additional utility for escrowed assets, such as delegation.
- **Verifiers**: The Arcade Lending Protocol uses a flexible, predicate-based ruleset for governing mutual agreement to lending terms when originating a loan. Counterparties can sign payloads, targeted towards specific verifiers, that can run custom logic express rules under which loans can be originated.

## CoreLending

### LoanCore

The hub logic contract of the protocol, which contains storage information about loans (expressed by the `LoanData` struct),
and all required logic to update storage to reflect loan state, as well as handle both the intake and release of asset custody
during the loan lifecycle. Only specialized "controller" contracts have the ability to call LoanCore (see [OriginationController](#OriginationController)
and [RepaymentController](#RepaymentController)).

During active loans, the collateral asset is owned by LoanCore. LoanCore also collects fees for the protocol, which
can be withdrawn by the contract owner. LoanCore also tracks global signature nonces for required protocol signatures.

### PromissoryNote

An ERC721 representing obligation in an active loan. When a loan begins, two types of notes - a `BorrowerNote` and `LenderNote` -
are minted to the respective loan counterparties. When a loan ends via payoff or default, these notes are burned. The token IDs of each
note are synced with the unique ID of the loan.

Only the holder of the `LenderNote` can claim defaulted collateral for a different loan, or redeem a note which was already been repaid. When a loan is active and secured by an AssetVault, only the holder of the `BorrowerNote` can access utility for the collateralized assets using the vault's `call` function.

### OriginationController

The entry point contract for all new loans - this contract has exclusive permission to call functions which begin new loans
in `LoanCore`. The Origination Controller is responsible for validating the submitted terms of any new loan, parsing and
validating counterparty signatures to loan terms, and handling delegation of signing authority for an address.

When a loan begins, the Origination Controller collects the principal from the lender, and the collateral from
the borrower. Loans can also be initialized with an ERC721 Permit message for collateral, removing the need for
a prior approval transaction from the borrower for assets which support `permit`.

In addition to new loans, the Origination Controller is the entry point for rollovers, which use funds from a new loan
to repay an old loan and define new terms. In this case, the origination controller contract nets out funds
from the old and new loan, and collects any needed balance from the responsible party.

### RepaymentController

The repayment controller handles all lifecycle progression for currently active loans - this contract has exclusive
permission to call functions in `LoanCore` which repay loans, in whole or in part, or claim collateral on loan defaults.
This contract is responsible for validating repayments inputs, calculating owed amounts, and collecting owed amounts
from the relevant counterparty. This contract also contains a convenience function for calculating the total amount
due on any loan at a given time.

### FeeController

The fee controller is a contract containing functions that return values for assessed protocol
fees at different parts of the loan lifecycle. The fee amounts can be updated by the contract owner.

## Vaults

### VaultFactory

The Vault Factory is an ERC721 that tracks ownership of Asset Vault contracts (see OwnableERC721). Minting a new
VaultFactory token involves deploying a new AssetVault clone, and assigning the token's ID to the uint160 derived
from the clone's address.

Token ownership represents ownership of the underlying clone contract and can be transferred - however, to prevent
frontrunning attacks, any vault with withdrawals enabled cannot be transferred (see [AssetVault](#AssetVault)).

### AssetVault

The Asset Vault is a holding contract that functions as a bundling mechanism for multiple assets. Assets deposited
into the vault can only be withdrawn by the owner, and the vault contract itself's ownership is tracked by
an ERC721 (see [VaultFactory](#VaultFactory)).

AssetVaults are created with withdrawals disabled, and enabling withdrawals is an irreversible "unwrapping" operation.
Vaults with withdrawals enabled cannot be transferred. Deposits are always possible, by sending a given asset to the
vault's contract address. Asset Vaults can hold ETH, ERC20s, ERC721, ERC1155, and CryptoPunks.

The owner of a vault can also place an arbitrary `call` via the vault, in order to access utility derived from
NFTs held in the vault. Other contracts can delegate the ability to make calls. In practice, an Asset Vault custodied
by LoanCore delegates calling ability to the borrower, such that the borrower can access utility for a collateralized
vault. The protocol maintains a list of allowed calls (see [CallWhitelist](#CallWhitelist)).

### CallWhitelist

A global whitelist contract that all Asset Vaults refer to in order to allow/disallow certain calldata from being
used in the vault's `call` functionality. Transfer methods are blacklisted in order to prevent backdoor withdrawals from
vaults. The contract owner can choose to add or remove target addresses and function selectors from the list.

The extensions `CallWhitelistApprovals` and `CallWhitelistDelegation` add similar functionality for token approvals and [delegate.cash](https://delegate.cash/) delegations respectively.

## Verifiers

### ItemsVerifier

A contract that parses a payload of calldata and a target AssetVault, and decodes the payload in order to use it
for logic proving or disproving defined predicates about the vault. The ItemsVerifier decodes the calldata
as a list of required items the vault must hold in order for its predicates to pass. In the future, other contracts
implementing `ISignatureVerifier` can support other calldata formats and associated validation logic.

The following verifier extensions have been implemented:

- `ArtBlocksVerifier.sol` can be used to specify project-specific collection-wide offers for ArtBlocks assets, which use a shared contract.
- `CollectionWideOfferVerifier.sol` allows lenders to sign offers against any `tokenId` of a particular ERC721 token. In addition, the signature is agnostic to whether that asset is escrowed directly or is escrowed within a vault.
- `PunksVerifier.sol` allows collection-wide offers on CryptoPunks.
- `UnvaultedItemsVerifier.sol` allows counterparties to propose collection-wide offers on assets that will be escrowed directly, without a vault.

## Version 2

This is version 3 of the protocol. Version 2 of the protocol can be found [here](https://github.com/Non-fungible-Technologies/v2-contracts).

# Privileged Roles and Access

The Arcade Lending Protocol is an immutable, non-upgradeable protocol: there defined roles below specify the entire scope of current and future control any organization may have over the operation of the protocol. These roles are designed such that operational responsibility can be modularized and decentralized. In practice, the V3 protocol is owned by a set of governance smart contract that can execute the results of DAO votes.

- `CallWhitelist` and derived contracts are `Ownable` and have a defined owner, who can update a whitelist of allowed calls. This whitelist is global to every `AssetVault` deployed through the `VaultFactory`. In plain terms, the `CallWhitelist` owner has the ability to change the allowed functions an `AssetVault` can call.
- `VaultFactory.sol` assigns three privileged roles: an admin, a fee claimer, and a resource manager. The resource manager can change the URI metadata of the VaultFactory NFT. The fee claimer can withdraw any mint fees collected by the contract. The admin can govern assignment of the fee claimer and resource manager roles.
- `FeeController.sol` is `Ownable` and has a defined owner, which can update the protocol fees. Internal constants define maximum fees that the protocol can set, preventing an attack whereby funds are drained via setting fees to 100%.
- `LoanCore.sol` is `AccessControl` and has a number of defined access roles:
  - The `ORIGINATOR` role is the only role allowed to access any functions which originate loans. In practice this role is granted to another smart contract, `OriginationController.sol`, which performs necessary checks and validation before starting loans. The `ADMIN` role can grant/revoke the `ORIGINATOR` role.
  - The `REPAYER` role is the only role allowed to access any functions which affect the loan lifecycle of currently active loans (repayment or default claims). In practice this role is granted to another smart contract, `RepaymentController.sol`, which performs necessary checks, calculations and validation before starting loans. The `ADMIN` role can grant/revoke the `REPAYER` role.
  - The `FEE_CLAIMER` role is the only role allowed claim accumulated protocol fees. The `ADMIN` role can grant/revoke the `FEE_CLAIMER` role.
  - The `AFFILIATE_MANAGER` role is the only role allowed to set affiliate splits for any fee collected during the loan lifecycle. The `ADMIN` role can grant/revoke the `AFFILIATE_MANAGER` role.
- `OriginationController.sol` is `AccessControl` and specifies an `ADMIN` role and a `WHITELIST_MANAGER`. The latter role can update the principal currency, collateral, and verifier whitelists. The `ADMIN` role can grant or revoke the `WHITELIST_MANAGER` role.
- `PromissoryNote.sol` has three defined roles: the `MINT/BURN` role allows the assigned address the ability to mint and burn tokens. For protocol operation, this would be `LoanCore`. The `RESOURCE_MANAGER` role allows the update of NFT metadata. The `ADMIN` role can grant/revoke the `MINT/BURN` role and `RESOURCE_MANAGER` role. In practice, after the note contract is initialized, the admin role is revoked in such a way it can never be regained.
