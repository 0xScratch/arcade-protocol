- Upgradeability and dependency architecture
  - Decide - which contracts should be upgradeable? What upgradeability pattern should they use?
  - Decide - which dependencies need to get passed in constructors for each contract?
  - Decide - of those dependencies, which should be changeable by an admin? Which should be immutable and/or only changeable by upgrade?
