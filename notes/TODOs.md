Mouzayan:

- Upgradeability and dependency architecture\
  ✅ &nbsp; Decide - which contracts should be upgradeable? What upgradebility pattern should they use?\
  ✅ &nbsp; Decide - which dependencies need to get passed in constructors for each contract?\
  ✅ &nbsp; Decide - of those dependencies, which should be changeable by an admin? Which should be immutable and / or only changeable by upgrade?\
  ✅ &nbsp; Outline the path to UUPS + ways to avoid storage clashes
- Outline changes to v2 Protocol to add upgradeability

✅ &nbsp; Future Scenarios List: What May Need to Change in the Future Scenarios\
✅ &nbsp; For each scenario, how would we make it possible? admin function or upgradeability etc...

✅ &nbsp; Look into [OZ upgrades plugin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/) for checks for conflicts, adds a deployment history you can check into git, wrapped "upgrade" functions for deploy scripts + other features\
✅ &nbsp; Compare with [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Upgradeability-Checks) plugin
